  6. PRODUCTS AND SERVICES
</h2>
<p class="privacy-text">
  All products are made to order based on your custom specifications, and therefore cannot be cancelled once you approve
  your proof or the order’s proof-bypass window has passed. You, the customer, are responsible for ensuring that your
  order correctly specifies size, color, artwork, quantity, style of product, and type of product. Packnow is not
  responsible for errors made by the customer during the ordering process.
 <br><br>
  We have made every effort to display as accurately as possible on the website the colors, images, and artwork you
  upload onto a product design. We also have made every effort to ensure that the proportions and style of all
  customizable products appear as accurately as possible. We cannot guarantee that your computer monitor's display of
  any color, artwork, sizing, or feature will be accurate.
 <br><br>
  We reserve the right to refuse any order you place with us. We reserve the right, but are not obligated, to limit the
  sales of our products or Service to any geographic region or jurisdiction. We may exercise this right on a
  case-by-case basis. We reserve the right to limit the quantities of any products or services that we offer. All
  descriptions of products or services, or product or service pricing, are subject to change at any time without notice,
  at our sole discretion. We reserve the right to modify or discontinue any product or service at any time. Any offer
  for any product or service made on this site is void where prohibited.
 <br><br>
  We do not warrant that the quality of any products, services, information, or other material purchased or obtained by
  you will meet your expectations or other requirements, or that any errors in the Service will be corrected in a timely
  manner or at all.
</p>

<h2 class="sub-privacy">
  7. RETURN POLICY, REFUNDS, AND DISPUTES
</h2>
<p class="privacy-text">
  Since all orders are made to custom specifications, we don't allow cancellation with refund or credit after proof
  acceptance or after the proof-bypass window is passed, nor do we allow returns on completed orders. However, if you're
  unhappy with your order and feel like we didn't do a great job, please contact us within 30 days of receiving the
  order and we'll do our best to rectify the situation. Should we, in our sole discretion, decide to replace any
  products or to refund or credit to you any amounts paid for an order, that replacement, refund, or credit shall
  constitute our entire, sole and exclusive liability, and your sole and exclusive remedy, with respect to that order.
 <br><br>
  If Packnow agrees to refund any amounts to Customer, then Customer understands and agrees that such refund shall
  shall be refunded to Customer by means of how the original payment by Customer was made (e.g., credit card). In the
  case of orders placed by Customer using a line of credit, any refunds will first be settled against any outstanding
  Packnow credit and then, with respect to any remainder that is due and owing to Customer, such remaining amount shall
  be refunded to Customer by means of how the original payment made by Customer (e.g., credit card).
 <br><br>
  If you dispute any charge that is made to your credit/debit card, you agree that Packnow may authorize a third party
  vendor to handle and seek to resolve such dispute on Packnow’s behalf, which may include Packnow providing such
  vendor with the following information: your name, physical address, email address, phone number and the first 6 and
  last 4 digits of your credit/debit card number. You agree that Packnow may provide such information to the third
  party vendor and that the third party vendor may further disclose that information to your credit/debit card company,
  the bank issuing the credit/debit card and Packnow’s merchant processing company for the purpose of resolving the
  dispute. Packnow will endeavor to have the third party vendor agree to maintain the confidentiality of such
  information.
 <br><br>
  If you dispute valid charges made by Packnow to your credit/debit card and your dispute is subsequently found to be
  fraudulent, you agree to reimburse Packnow for Packnow’s expenses (including bank’s and attorney’s fees) incurred in
  connection with resolving the dispute.
